## Project 1: Predict house sale prices
- Description: This project uses Kaggle's house price dataset to predict sale prices with advanced regression models. It incorporates ensemble learning and hyperparameter optimization across models like Lasso, Ridge, SVR, LightGBM, and XGBoost. The dataset includes 79 features, enabling detailed analysis for real estate pricing predictions.
- Dataset: Predict house sale prices using 79 explanatory variables.
- Problem Type: Regression
- Rows/Features: 1,460 rows, 79 features

## Project 2: Wine Quality Prediction
- Description: Using Kaggle’s Wine Quality dataset, this project predicts wine quality based on physicochemical properties like acidity, pH, and alcohol content. Classification models like Decision Trees and Random Forests identify high-quality wines (score ≥7). Data preprocessing, visualization, and feature selection are key steps in this analysis
- Dataset: Detect fraudulent credit card transactions using anonymized features.
- Problem Type: Classification
- Rows/Features: 284,807 rows, 30 features

## Project 3: Credit Card Fraud Detection
- Description: This project analyzes a highly imbalanced dataset of European credit card transactions to detect fraud. It applies machine learning algorithms on PCA-transformed features. Key metrics like Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) are used to evaluate performance due to the class imbalance
- Dataset: Predict wine quality based on physicochemical tests.
- Problem Type: Regression
- Rows/Features: 4,898 rows, 12 features
