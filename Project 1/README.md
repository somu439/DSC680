# Project 1: Predict House Sale Prices

## Overview
This project aims to predict house sale prices using Kaggle's house price dataset. By leveraging advanced regression models and ensemble learning techniques, the project seeks to deliver accurate price predictions based on a comprehensive set of 79 features.

## Objectives
- Analyze and preprocess the dataset for optimal model performance.
- Apply and compare multiple regression algorithms, including Lasso, Ridge, SVR, LightGBM, and XGBoost.
- Perform hyperparameter optimization to enhance model accuracy.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate regression metrics.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Kaggle House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques
- **Rows**: 1,460
- **Features**: 79 explanatory variables (e.g., lot size, year built, neighborhood)

## Key Steps
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis and visualization
3. Feature engineering and selection
4. Model training and evaluation
5. Ensemble modeling and hyperparameter tuning

## Problem Type
- Regression

## Expected Outcome
A robust regression model capable of accurately predicting house sale prices, providing insights into the most influential features affecting real estate values.
